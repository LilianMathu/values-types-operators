    <h3>Values, Types and Operators</h3>
    <h4>Identifier Names</h4>
    <p> Variable and constant names (as well as function names, which we’ll cover in Chap‐
        ter 6) are called identifiers, and they have naming rules:<br>
        • Identifiers must start with a letter, dollar sign ($), or underscore (_).<br>
        • Identifiers consist of letters, numbers, the dollar sign ($), and underscore (_).<br>
        • Unicode characters are allowed (for example, π or ö).<br>
        • Identifiers cannot be a reserved word.<br>
    </p>

    <p>A variable is essentially a named value, and as the name implies, the value can change at any time.
        It is conventional (but not required) for constants that refer to a specific number or
        string to be named with all uppercase letters and underscores. This makes them easy
        to spot in your code, and is a visual cue that you shouldn’t try to change their value.
        <br>
    </p>
    <h4>Literals</h4>
    <p>
        The word literal means that you’re providing the value directly in the program. Essentially,
        a literal is a way to create a value; JavaScript takes the literal value you provide and creates
        a data value from it.
        It’s important to understand the difference between a literal and an identifier.<br>
        JavaScript is able to distinguish the identifier from the literal by the use of quotation
        marks (numbers don’t need any sort of quotation because identifiers can’t start with a
        number). Consider the following example:<br>

        let room1 = "conference_room_a"; // "conference_room_a" (in quotes). It is a literal
    </p>
    <h4>Operators</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Multiplication</li>
        <li>Division</li>
        <li>Modulus</li>
        <li>Addition</li>
        <li>Subtraction</li>
        <li>Unary operator</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Unary Operators include:</b>
        <ol>
            <b>
                <li>typeof</li>
            </b>
            <p>
                typeof operator is a unary operator, i.e, it ooperates on one operand only.
                It produces a string value naming the type of the value
                you give it.<br>
                <pre><code>console.log(typeof 4.5)
                    // → number
                    console.log(typeof "x")
                    // → 'string'
                    typeof {};
                    //'object'
                    </code></pre>
                <pre><code>
                        console.log(type of "5" === 5);
                    </code>
                    </pre>
                <br>
                The result is false. This is because typeof operates on the "5" first. The result is a string.
                A stringis not equal to 5.
                <br>
                <pre><code>
                        console.log(typeof "name" === string);
                    </code></pre>
                <br>
                The code above will print true
            </p><br>

            <b>
                <li>Minus operator</li>
            </b>
            <p>
                The minus operator can be used both as a binary operator and as a <b>unary operator.</b>
                <pre><code> console.log(- (10 - 2))</code></pre>
            </p>

            <br>
            <b>
                <li>The ! operator</li>
            </b>
            <p>
                It turns a statement from negative to positive and from positive to negative.
            </p>

        </ol>
    </p>


    <br><br>
    <p>
        Modulus prints the remainder.
        <br>
        There are three special values in JavaScript that are considered numbers but
        don’t behave like normal numbers.
        they are: Infinity and -Infinity and NaN.
        <br>
        NaN stands for “not a number”, even though it is a value of the number type.
        You’ll get this result when you, for example, try to calculate 0 / 0 (zero divided
        by zero), Infinity - Infinity , or any number of other numeric operations that
        don’t yield a meaningful result.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h4>Strings</h4>
    <p>
        You can use single quotes, double quotes, or backticks to mark strings, as
        long as the quotes at the start and the end of the string match.<br>
        Newlines (the characters you get when you press enter) can be included without escaping only when
        the string is quoted with backticks ( \ ‘).

    </p>
    <p>
        Backtick-quoted strings, usually called template literals, can do a few more
        tricks. Apart from being able to span lines, they can also embed other values.<br>
        <pre><code> `half of 100 is ${100 / 2}` </code></pre>
    </p>
    <h4>Binary Operators</h4>
    <p>
        They operate on two values and produces either a true or a false.
        The way strings are ordered is roughly alphabetic but not really what you’d
        expect to see in a dictionary: <b>uppercase letters are always “less” than lowercase
            ones,</b> so "Z" < "a" , and nonalphabetic characters (!, -, and so on) are also included in the ordering.
            When comparing strings, JavaScript goes over the characters from left to right, comparing the Unicode codes
            one by one. Other similar operators are>= (greater than or equal to),
            and !=(not equal to).
    </p>
    <p>
        There is only one value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself, and that is
        NaN (“not a number”).
        <br>
        <pre><code>console.log(NaN == NaN)
        // → false

        </code></pre>
        <br>
        NaN is supposed to denote the result of a nonsensical computation, and as
        such, it isn’t equal to the result of any other nonsensical computations.
    </p>
    <h4>Logical operators</h4>
    <P>
        There are also some operations that can be applied to Boolean values them-
        selves. JavaScript supports three logical operators: and, or, and not. These
        can be used to “reason” about Booleans. <br>
        The && operator represents logical and. It is a binary operator, and its result
        is true only if both the values given to it are true.<br>
        The || operator denotes logical or. It produces true if either of the values
        given to it is true. <br>
        Not is written as an exclamation mark ( ! ). It is a unary operator that flips
        the value given to it— !true produces false , and !false gives true .
    </P>
    <p>
        <b>NB:</b>|| has the lowest precedence, then comes && , then the comparison operators ( > , == ,
        and so on), and then the rest.
    </p>
    <h4>Ternary operator</h4>
    <p>
        It operates on three values.It is written with a question mark and a colon, like
        this
        <pre><code>
        console.log(true ? 1 : 2);
        // → 1
        console.log(false ? 1 : 2);
        // → 2
        </code></pre>
        This one is called the conditional operator (or sometimes just the ternary
        operator since it is the only such operator in the language). The value on the
        left of the question mark “picks” which of the other two values will come out.
        When it is true, it chooses the middle value, and when it is false, it chooses the
        value on the right.
    </p>
    <h4>Empty values</h4>
    <p>
        There are two special values, written null and undefined , that are used to
        denote the absence of a meaningful value. They are themselves values, but
        they carry no information.
    </p>
    <h4>Objects</h4>
    <p>
        Like the primitive types, objects
        have a literal syntax: curly braces ( { and } ). Because curly braces come in pairs, it
        allows us to express an object’s contents. Let’s start with an empty object:<br>
        <pre><code>const obj = {};</code></pre>
        <br>
        The contents of an object are called properties (or members), and properties consist of
        a name (or key) and value. Property names must be strings or symbols, and values can
        be any type (including other objects).
        <br>
        <pre><code>
            const sam3 = {
                name: 'Sam',
                classification: {
                kingdom: 'Anamalia',
                phylum: 'Chordata',
                class: 'Mamalia',
                order: 'Carnivoria',
                family: 'Felidae',
                subfaimily: 'Felinae',
                genus: 'Felis',
                species: 'catus',
                },
                };
    </code></pre>
        <br>
        Consider the different ways we can access Sam the cat’s family (it also
        doesn’t matter if we use single or double quotes or even backticks):
        Objects
        <pre><code>
           //dot notation on both objects
            sam3.classification.family;<br>
           
           // using square brackets for one object. It could be the first of the second
            sam3["classification"].family;<br>
            sam3.classification["family"];<br>

           //Using square brackets for both objects 
            sam3["classification"]["family"];<br>

       </code></pre>

        <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Objects can also contain <b>functions</b>. Here’s how we add a function to sam3 :<br>

        <pre><code>
        sam3.speak = function() { return "Meow!"; };<br>
        </code></pre>


        We can now call that function by adding parentheses to it:<br>


        <pre><code>
         sam3.speak();      // "Meow!"
        </code></pre>

        Lastly, we can delete a property from an object with the delete operator:
        <pre><code>
            delete sam3.classification;
            delete sam3.speak;
            // the whole classification tree is removed
            // the speak function is removed
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <h4>Arrays</h4>
    <p>
        Arrays in JavaScript have the following properties:<br>
        • Array size is not fixed; you can add or remove elements at any time.<br>
        • Arrays are not homogeneous; each individual element can be of any type.<br>
        • Arrays are zero-based. That is, the first element in the array is element 0.<br>
        <br>
        To create an array literal in JavaScript, use square brackets, with the elements of the
        array separated by commas:<br>
        const a1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];<br>
        Arrays have a property length , which returns the number of elements in the array:
        <pre><code>
            const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
            arr.length;
            // 3
        </code></pre>
        <br>
        Arrays have a property length , which returns the number of elements in the array:
        <pre><code>
            const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
            arr.length;
            // 3
        </code></pre>

        To access individual elements of an array, we simply use the numeric index of the ele‐
        ment inside square brackets (similar to how we access properties on an object):
        <pre><code>

            const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
            
            // get the first element:
            arr[0];
            // ->'a'

            // the index of the last element in arr is arr.length-1:
            arr[arr.length - 1];
            // ->'c'
        </code></pre>

        To overwrite the value at a specific array index, you can simply assign to it:
        <pre><code>

            const arr = [1, 2, 'c', 4, 5];
            arr[2] = 3;
            // arr is now [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        </code></pre>
        <b>NOTE: </b>If you assign an index that is equal to or larger than the length of the array, the size of
        the array will increase to accommodate the new element.

    </p>
    <h4>Data Type Conversion</h4>
    <p>
        <b>Converting to Numbers</b>
        It’s very common to want to convert strings to numbers. When you collect input from
        a user, it’s usually as a string, even if you’re collecting a numeric value from them.
        JavaScript offers a couple of methods to convert strings to numbers. The first is to use
        the Number object constructor:<br>
        <pre><code>
                const numStr = "33.3";
                const num = Number(numStr);
                // this creates a number value, *not*
                // an instance of the Number object

            </code></pre>
        <br>
        If the string can’t be converted to a number, NaN will be returned.<br>
        The second approach is to use the built-in <b>parseInt or parseFloat </b>functions. These
        behave much the same as the Number constructor, with a couple of exceptions. With
        parseInt , you can specify a<b> radix</b>, which is the base with which you want to parse the
        number. For example, this allows you to specify base 16 to parse hexadecimal num‐
        bers. It is always recommended you specify a radix, even if it is 10 (the default).<br>
        <pre><code>
                    const a = parseInt("16 volts", 10);          //the " volts" is ignored, 16 is
                                                                 //parsed in base 10
                    <br>                                              
                    const b = parseInt("3a", 16);                //parse hexadecimal 3a; result is 58
                    <br>
                    
                    const c = parseFloat("15.5 kph");             //the " kph" is ignored; parseFloat
                                                                 //always assumes base 10
                    console.log(c);
                    //->15.5
                    //->undefined
            </code></pre>
        <br>
        Sometimes, it is useful to convert boolean values to 1 (true) or 0 (false). The conver‐
        sion uses the conditional.
        <pre><code>
                const b = true;
                const n = b ? 1 : 0;
        </code></pre>

    </p>
    <h4>Converting to String</h4>
    <p>
        All objects in JavaScript have a method toString() , which returns a string represen‐
        tation. In practice, the default implementation isn’t particularly useful. It works well
        for numbers, though it isn’t often necessary to convert a number to a string: that con‐
        version usually happens automatically during string concatenation or interpolation.
        But if you ever do need to convert a number to a string value, the toString() method
        is what you want:
        <pre><code>
                const n = 33.5;
                n;
                // 33.5 - a number
                const s = n.toString();
                s;
                // "33.5" - a string

                const arr = [1, true, "hello"];
                arr.toString();
                // "1,true,hello"
           </code></pre>
    </p>
    <h4>Converting to Boolean</h4>
    <p>
        You can convert any value to a boolean by using the “not” operator ( ! )
        twice. Using it once converts the value to a boolean, but the opposite of what you
        want; using it again converts it to what you expect. As with numeric conversion, you
        can also use the Boolean constructor (again, without the new keyword) to achieve the
        same result:<br>
        <pre><code>
            const n = 0;
            const b1 = !!n;
            const b2 = Boolean(n);
            // "falsy" value
            // false
            // false
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <b>note: </b>The function Number converts a value to a number.
    <br>
    console.log(Number("5"));
    <br>
    The Number.isNaN function is a standard JavaScript function that returns
    true only if the argument it is given is NaN . The Number function happens to
    return NaN when you give it a string that doesn’t represent a valid number
