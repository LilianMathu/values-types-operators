    <h4>Expressions and statements</h4>
    <p>
        A fragment of code that produces a value is called an expression. Every value
        that is written literally (such as 22 or "psychoanalysis" ) is an expression. An
        expression between parentheses is also an expression, as is a binary operator
        applied to two expressions or a unary operator applied to one.
        <br>
        <b>JavaScript statement</b>
        corresponds to a full sentence. A program is a list of statements.
        The simplest kind of statement is an expression with a semicolon after it.
    </p>
    <h4>Control flow</h4>
    <p>

        <b>while statement</b>
        <pre><code>
        while(condition){
        statement;
        }
        </code></pre>
        While condition is truthy, statement will be executed.
        <br>


        <b>if...else statement</b>
        <pre><code>
        if(condition){
        statement;
        }
        else{
           statement2] 
        }
        </code></pre>
        <br> otherwise, statement2 will be
        executed (assuming the else part is present).
        If condition is truthy, statement1 will be executed; otherwise, statement2 will be
        executed (assuming the else part is present).
        <br><br>


        <b>do...while statement</b>
        <pre><code>
        do{
        statement
        increment;
        }
        while(condition){
            stmts;

        };
        </code></pre>
        statement is executed at least once, and is repeatedly executed as long as condition
        is truthy.
    <br>

  <b> for statement</b>
        <pre><code>
            for([initialization]; [condition]; [final-expression]){
            statement;
            }
        </code></pre>
        <br>

        Before the loop runs, initialization is executed. As long as condition is true,
        statement is executed, then final-expression is executed before testing condition
        again.
    </p>
